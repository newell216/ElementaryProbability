Games that introduce probability to young students; approximately grades K-3

Both games involve rolling dice, calculating sums, and discovering the probability of rolling each sum. Younger 
students should begin with the two dice game and move onto the three dice game. Older or advanced students might skip
the two dice game altogether.
