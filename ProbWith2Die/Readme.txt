Ages: 5-8
Players: 2-4 per board
Materials: two dice, ProbGameBoard2Die.pdf, one of the three TwoDieSum pdfs.

Game Play: 
1) Place one small token on each number, 0-13, at the bottom of the game board.
2) Students take turn rolling two dice and calculating the sum.
3) The student who rolled the sum moves the token from that number one step forward. For example, if a 4 and 6 are 
rolled, the student will move the token on the 10 one step forward. If a sum of 10 is rolled again later in the game, 
that same token will move another step forward.
4) Continue playing until one token reaches the end of the board. That token is the "winner". Emphasize that the token
won, not the person who last moved the token.
5) Almost invariably, the tokens will spread out on the board in somewhat of a parabolic formation (also thought
of as a bell curve). The token on numbers 5-7 will win.
6) After the game has been played several times (or by several groups that compared results), distribute 
any one of the TwoDieSums pdf's. This gives students the opportunity to analize why certain tokens seems
to always move a lot, while others hardly budge. 

Note: Three TwoDieSum pdf's can be found in this folder. Educators that wish for students to fill in the chart with 
numbers will use TwoDieSumNumbers.pdf. Those who wish for students to fill in the chart using dots will use 
TwoDieSumDots.pdf. Those who will let students choose can use TwoDieSumBlank.pdf
Students filling in the chart with numbers likely will quickly identify simple patterns and fill in most of the 
chart by mindlessly following them instead of actually doing the addition. This may be ok so long as a 
discussion about patterns throughout the chart follows the activity.
