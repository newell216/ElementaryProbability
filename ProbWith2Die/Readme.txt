Credits: Math from Three to Seven: The Story of a Mathematical Circle for Preschoolers
Author: Alexander Zvonkin
MSRI Mathematical Circles Library


Ages: 5-8
Players: 2-4 per board
Materials: two dice, ProbGameBoard2Die.pdf, one of the three TwoDieSum pdfs.

Note: Three TwoDieSum pdf's can be found in this folder. Educators that wish for students to fill in the chart with 
numbers will use TwoDieSumNumbers.pdf. Those who wish for students to fill in the chart using dots will use 
TwoDieSumDots.pdf. Those who will let students choose can use TwoDieSumBlank.pdf
Students filling in the chart with numbers likely will quickly identify simple patterns and fill in most of the 
chart by mindlessly following them instead of actually doing the addition. This may be ok so long as a 
discussion about patterns throughout the chart follows the activity.
